33 year old Glauber Contesso is a Dogecoin Millionaire. He got famous after he posted his portfolio on Reddit. He had only learned about Dogecoin 2 months before, but ended up putting his entire life savings into it.

Glouber Contesso put a massive $250,000 into buying doge, and it paid off massively. At the height of Elon Musk's tweets, the price of the coin had grown over 21,000%. By this point, Glauber's Dogecoin profile had grown so much that he had become a crypto millionaire.

Sad news is that it didn't last very long. By June, Dogecoin's price had dropped so low that Glauber had lost his millionaire status. He still refused to sell at this point, and believes the coin can achieve higher rates in the future. He later revealed that he had lost over $167,000 in a single day, due to declining value.

Despite the fact that he turned from a famous Dogecoin millionaire to a normal investor, he still didn't give up. Today he has turned his attention to the coin named Cardano. "I'm going to be the biggest Cardano supporter", he commented. "I'm just waiting for a massive dip before buying it. "
