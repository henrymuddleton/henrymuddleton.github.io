 The first bitcoin transaction was completed on January 12, 2009. Then on May 22, 2010, Bitcoin was just a year old and a Laszlo Hanyecz decided to buy 2 pizzas for $10,000 BTC. At that time 10,000 bitcoins is only worth $30, but little did he know 10 years later that $30 would be worth $500 million.
 
 May 22, 2010 is now known as "Bitcoin Pizza Day". Laszlo Hanyecz, an early adopter of bitcoin and ally of the anonymous founder Satoshi Nakamoto, went to an online Bitcoin forum and posted a request to order 2 large pizzas to be delivered to his home in florida. A coder from the UK accepted the deal and called Papa John's in Jacksonille, and paid 2 large pizzas with his credit card. Hanyecz sent over the 10,000 bitcoins, and a confused deliveryman showed up at his door with 2 pizzas. "Pizza delivery from London?", he said with an unsure voice.
 
 At that time, Bitcoin was valued at less than a penny, around $0.003. So 10,000 bitcoins would be worth around $30. Now 10 years later, that same transaction equates to over $500 million.
 
 Hanyecz, however, has never regretted the purchase.
